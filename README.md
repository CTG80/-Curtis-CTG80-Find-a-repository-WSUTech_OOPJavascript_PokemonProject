An application that displays information about Pokemon using the PokeAPI. https://pokeapi.co/Links to an external site.

Requirements

1. Fetch the generation 1 Pokemon from the API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151Links to an external site.) and display a list of their names. Do some string formatting on the names to make them display better (uppercasing, etc.)

2. Make each name clickable, so that when you click on a name, it makes an additional request to the API to fetch the detailed data for that pokemon.

3. Using JS DOM methods, create a detailed card or view for the selected Pokemon displaying its name, a sprite (image), types, and pokedex number (id).

4. Ensure the user can always select another Pokemon from the list.
